# Project Summary

## Overview of Languages, Frameworks, and Main Libraries Used
The project is primarily developed in **Java** and utilizes the **Spring Framework** for building a web application. The project structure suggests the use of **Spring Boot**, which simplifies the configuration and setup of Spring applications. The project likely employs various Spring components such as Spring Security for authentication and authorization, and Spring Data JPA for data access.

## Purpose of the Project
The project appears to be a web application related to an educational management system, possibly for managing inventory, user roles, schedules, and other entities associated with an educational institution. The presence of controllers, services, and repositories indicates a layered architecture, typical for applications following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern.

- **Build File:**  
  - `/pom.xml` - This is the Maven project configuration file that contains project dependencies, build configurations, and plugin definitions.

- **Wrapper Scripts:**  
  - `/mvnw` - This is the Maven wrapper script for Unix-based systems.
  - `/mvnw.cmd` - This is the Maven wrapper script for Windows systems.

## Source Files Directory
Source files can be found in the following directory:
- `/src/main/java/edu/cit/lemslite` - This directory contains the main Java source files, including application entry points, controllers, services, entities, repositories, and configuration files.

## Documentation Files Location
Documentation files are not explicitly listed in the provided file structure. However, configuration-related documentation may be found in:
- `/src/main/resources/application.properties` - This file typically contains configuration properties for the application, which may serve as a form of documentation regarding application settings.

For additional documentation, it is common to include README files or other markdown files, but none are indicated in the current structure.
